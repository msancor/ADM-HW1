In particular, I took the solution by [markosandres45](https://www.hackerrank.com/markosandres45) as a guideline and the credit for the main idea should go to him/her. Nevertheless I implemented a new logic where I initialized a ```current_block_size``` variable in order to check which cube length was greater and make the code more readable."

Nevertheless I couldn't find out how to check the condition that characters shoudn't repeat. This is why I consulted the [Discussions](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/validating-uid/forum) section of the problem and tested the solution given by [avoscanemile](https://www.hackerrank.com/avoscanemile) in order to comprehend how to do this. Then I consulted the functioning of a negative lookahead assertion on the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) and implemented it. In the comments you can find a part by part explanation of my Regex."
